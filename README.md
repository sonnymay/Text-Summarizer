# Text Summarizer

A simple python-based text summarization tool created by Sonnymay.

## Project Description

This project provides a basic implementation of a text summarization algorithm. It utilizes Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to tokenize the input text, calculate frequency distributions, and select the most important sentences based on their word frequencies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* NLTK: Install using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/sonnymay/text-summarizer.git
```

## Usage

```python
from text_summarizer import summarize

text = "Your text here..."
summary = summarize(text)
print(summary)
```
